          <h2>Welcome to my page!</h2>
          
          <p>I am a passionate researcher and educator dedicated to advancing knowledge at the intersection of artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and computational social science. My work focuses on developing AI systems that are not only technically robust but also ethically grounded and socially beneficial.</p>
          
          <p>With a Ph.D. in Computer Science and several years of research experience, I have published extensively in top-tier conferences and journals. My research spans multiple domains, from machine learning algorithms to their societal implications, always with an eye toward creating technology that serves humanity's best interests.</p>
          
          <p>Currently, I serve as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science, where I lead a research group focused on responsible AI development. I am also actively involved in several interdisciplinary collaborations that bridge computer science with psychology, sociology, and ethics.</p>
